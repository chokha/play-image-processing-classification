title=Image Processing & Classification Webservice Template
description=A Play Framework webservice that analyses images and classifies the resulting feature vectors. The image processing is done using OpenCV (http://opencv.org/). For the classification the service uses the data mining framework Weka (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/). The process is executed using akka. The resulting feature vectors and classes are stored in mongoDB (https://www.mongodb.org/) where image data is stored with GridFS. The project can be used as a basis for webservice based image processing and classification.
